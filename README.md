# Atrium

**See how they think.**

Atrium is an AI-powered technical interview platform that replaces LeetCode with paid, real-world challenges. Interviewers set up custom interviews by chatting with an Opus 4.6 agent — uploading a job description, candidate resume, and their SDK documentation. The AI generates a tailored coding challenge and builds a custom evaluation rubric.

During the session, candidates work in a cloud sandbox (E2B) with Claude Code. Three Opus 4.6 agents work together: an Interview Architect that designs the challenge through conversation, a Session Observer that evaluates the candidate's reasoning patterns against the custom rubric in real-time, and an Interviewer Copilot that suggests follow-up questions based on the interviewer's stated priorities.

The interviewer's dashboard shows a live swim-lane timeline of the candidate's activity — AI prompts, file changes, terminal commands, reasoning signals — with an AI-generated evaluation scored against their custom rubric.
